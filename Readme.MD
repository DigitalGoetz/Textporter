# Textporter

Script for bundling projects for transport via Text-Only Transfer Services (TOTS).

## Usage

Use the beam up script to create a bundle text file for transfer via TOTS; use the beaming down to reintegrate the data on the high side.

### Beaming Up

The beam up script (scripts/beamup.py) takes a target directory and walks the directory's contents gathering all of the files and converting these into filename-filecontent pairs.  These are then output to a bundle file containing line-by-line entries of file name and base64 encoded file contents.

### Beaming Down

The beam down script takes a bundle file generated by the beam up script and a target directory.  It then rebuilds the original target directory and all of its contents within the target directory.

## Examples

```bash
TARGET=./dummy BUNDLE=bundle python3 scripts/beamup.py

# the file "bundle" is now in the current working directory containing:
# dummy/b
# MTIzNDU2
# dummy/c
# MTI0M3Jld3FlcmFzZGZhc2Rm
# dummy/a
# YXNkZmFzZGZhc2RmYXNkZmFzZGY=
# dummy/d/1
# b3Jhbmdl
# dummy/d/2
# YXBwbGU=

TARGET=./clone BUNDLE=bundle python3 scripts/beamdown.py

# the directory "clone" is now created containing all of the original contents of "dummy"

```
